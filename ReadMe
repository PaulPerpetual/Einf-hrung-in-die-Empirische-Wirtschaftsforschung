This is the LaTex code to the summary of the "Introductory Economics Course". I was always upset if I had a great summary from the web and wanted to make a small change or spotted a mistake I basically had to rewrite the whole thing. This I imagine to be a place where we can iteratively improve on the given summary.

If you have never worked with GitHub or Overleaf before. Consider learning it it is easy enough.

If you are a student of UZH you should be able to log in on overleaf.com using the instuttional log in. There you can open this project directly from GitHub!

From the New Project menu, you can select the GitHub option. This will present you with a list of repositories that are visible to Overleaf through your GitHub account, based on your GitHub permission settings.

For more details have a look here! https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_Git_and_GitHub

Of course you can also just download ("clone") the main.tex file and paste it to your latex editor of choice.
